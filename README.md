This analysis examined four cancer drugs for squamous cell carcinoma in male and female mice. These drugs were effective in reducing tumor volumes across treatment time. 

Ramicane and Capomulin both resulted in lower tumor volumes than Infubinol and Ceftamin. This means that they may be more effective. 

Mouse s185 had decreasing tumor volume across time points, which means that Capomulin was effective for reducing their tumor. 

Increasing mouse weight is associated with increasing tumor volume, which means that bigger mice have bigger tumors on average, which is sensible.
